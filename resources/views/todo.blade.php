    <h1 class="ml-2 mb-2">Todo List</h1>
    - Integrate ChatGPT into the site
    <br>
    - Eventually make a way to let ChatGPT edit the site? Could make the output of ChatGPT detectable by a script that
    then changes the site, tell ChatGPT what it can do
    <br>
    - Find vulnerabilities
    <br>
    - Weather Alerts and Other Alerts
    <br>
    - Quote of the day at the bottom of the home page. There are APIs for this.
    <br>
    - MySQL or SQLite as database
    <br>
    - Add "beta features" to the website in the other stuff page
    <br>
    - Integrate a site-wide dark mode
    <br>
    - You can use "API Ninjas", a site that supplies loads of free APIs
    <br>
    - IMPORTANT: Create SQLite database (Check the Eloquant API)
    <br>
    - IMPORTANT: An alert for high wind speeds (and similar stuff) with the openweathermap API. It can be displayed ontop/under the navigation buttons.
    <br>
    - IMPORTANT: Figure out how to add Javascript
    <br>
    - IMPORTANT: Optimize mobile experience, especially on the other-stuff page
    <br>
    - Make a seperate site or add pages to this that are similar to Google's Gemini and Google Deepmind website
    <br>
    - Add a section to the Legion Manager where I can view the date added/uploaded of the Legion
    <br>
    <p class="text-red-600">- IMPORTANT: Create a form so that you can add Space Marine legions to the legion database in
        the server.</p>
